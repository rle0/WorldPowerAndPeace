README.txt

This folder contains three solving clients and
several problem or game formulations.
There is one interactive solving client:
  Int_Solv_Client4.py
and there are two automatic solving clients:
  MinimalAutoPlayer.py
  RandomAutoPlayer.py

The problem/game formulations are in the files:
  TowersOfHanoi.py
  HumansRobotsFerry.py
  FoxAndHounds.py
  TestFormulationParamOpInt.py
  TestFormulationParamOpFloatStr.py
  

To run any client with any problem/game use the
following format of command

> python Int_Solv_Client4.py TowersOfHanoi

You might have to use "python3" instead of "python"
depending on how your Python installation is set up.

Another example is

> python RandomAutoPlayer.py FoxAndHounds

The file soluzion.py serves as a library module and
is imported by several of the other files.
