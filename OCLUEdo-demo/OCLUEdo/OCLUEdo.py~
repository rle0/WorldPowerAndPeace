'''OCLUEdo.py  (formerly HalfClue.py)
("The Cards Half of the game of 'Clue'")
A SOLUZION problem formulation, for ZZ003.py.

First created in the Spring of 2020, during
the Covid-19 pandemic, this program provided
a means to handle the secret information aspects
of playing a game of CLUE online.
This included initial dealing of cards, with a
random "murder set" of (room, person, weapon),
and a random deal of the remaining cards to 
all the players.  This program was intended to
be used at the same time that a Zoom session
would happen, with one person using a real Clue
board and a webcam to share the board in Zoom,
and that person also rolling the dice for all
the other online players, moving tokens as
they requested.

The new game of OCLUEdo is a full game, but
with a much simpler board, and without dice.
Players still get to move to different places,
but other than the starting squares and the
rooms, there are only 9 other locations.
Instead of being squares on the board, they
are "lobbies" with one just outside of each
Clue room.  To go into a Clue room, you have
to first move to its lobby (unless you come
via secret passages, as in standard Clue).

PROBLEM_DESC=\
 '''The game of <b>"OCLUEdo"</b> is a variation of the board game
known as Clue in the USA and Cluedo in the UK with cards and dice,
Clue dates back to World War II, first under the name of Cluedo.
OCLUEdo has the same rooms, characters, and weapons as Clue
(classic version rather than more recent Hasbro variations).
However, instead of players moving around the large Clue board
using dice, OCLUEdo uses a more restricted board and no dice.
<br>
  The cards portion of the game includes the following: setting up
a random selection of murderer, weapon and room before the game
begins, which the players will have to figure out; dealing the
remaining cards randomly to the players at the beginning of the
game, and then managing the business of "suggestions" about the
murder, and the showing of cards by one person secretly to another.
